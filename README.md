# Road Accident Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating and analyzing a dashboard that visualizes **road accident statistics**. The purpose of the dashboard is to help identify key metrics and trends in road accidents, such as total casualties, breakdown by vehicle type, road surface conditions, and accident distribution by day and month. The dashboard provides stakeholders with a comprehensive view of how road accidents are influenced by various factors.

## Objectives

- **Visualize Road Accident Data**: Create a dashboard to display crucial accident metrics such as total casualties, severity (fatal, serious, slight), and breakdown by vehicle type and road conditions.
- **Analyze Patterns**: Identify patterns in road accidents by examining the time, road surface, light conditions, and accident type.
- **Assist Decision Making**: Provide insights to help reduce road accidents by highlighting high-risk conditions and areas.

## Data Source

The dataset includes the following key fields:

- **Casualties by type**: Fatal, Serious, Slight
- **Vehicle type**: Car, Bicycle, Motorcycle, Bus, Tractor, etc.
- **Road conditions**: Dry, Wet, Snow, etc.
- **Time-based data**: Days of the week, Months, Light conditions (Daylight, Dark), Road type
- **Geographic data**: Casualties by area (Urban, Rural)

## Tools Used

- **Data Visualization Tool**: Tableau
- **Data Processing Tools**: SQL, Excel (for data cleaning and preparation)
- **Programming Language (Optional)**: Python (for additional data analysis and automation)

## Key Metrics Visualized in the Dashboard

1. **Total Casualties**:
   - The dashboard shows a total of **417,883 casualties** with breakdowns by severity:
     - **Fatal**: 7,135
     - **Serious**: 59,312
     - **Slight**: 351,436

2. **Vehicle Type Casualties**:
   - A breakdown of casualties by vehicle type shows:
     - **Cars**: 333,485
     - **Bicycles**: 33,672
     - **Motorcycles**: 33,472
     - **Buses**: 12,798
     - **Tractors**: 1,032

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Monthly comparison of casualties in **2021 vs. 2022**.

4. **Casualties by Road Type**:
   - Most accidents happen on **single carriageways**.

5. **Casualties by Road Surface Condition**:
   - The majority of accidents occur on **dry surfaces**.

6. **Casualties by Area**:
   - Split between **Urban** and **Rural** areas.

7. **Casualties by Light Conditions**:
   - Daylight accidents account for most casualties.

8. **Casualties by Day of the Week**:
   - Accidents are distributed across the week, with peaks on certain days.

## Insights and Analysis

- **High Casualties Involving Cars**: Cars are the most involved vehicles in accidents, indicating that targeted road safety campaigns for car drivers could have a large impact.
  
- **Daylight Accidents**: The majority of accidents happen in daylight, suggesting other contributing factors like traffic volume or road conditions.
  
- **Single Carriageways**: Most accidents happen on single carriageways, which could indicate a need for better road safety measures in these areas.

- **Geographical Insights**: Higher accidents in urban areas suggest more focus on improving urban traffic management and infrastructure.

## Recommendations

- **Safety Campaigns**: Focus on targeting car drivers with educational campaigns, particularly for driving on single carriageways.
  
- **Improve Road Safety**: Implement stricter safety measures on single carriageways and improve road infrastructure where accidents are more frequent.

- **Analyze Light Conditions**: Despite more accidents happening in daylight, analyzing specific causes in daylight accidents might improve overall road safety.

## Future Work

- **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning models to predict accident-prone areas or periods based on historical data.
  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Map accidents to specific locations to identify geographic hotspots for road accidents.

- **Detailed Vehicle Analysis**: Explore the impact of specific vehicle types (e.g., motorcycles vs bicycles) to better understand their roles in road accidents.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of road accident data, revealing patterns and offering actionable insights for reducing road casualties. The dashboard can serve as a valuable tool for policymakers, road safety agencies, and urban planners to develop targeted strategies for improving road safety.
